<h1>The Best Movies According to André Moré</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Lord of the Rings: Return of the King</h3>
<p>This is the best movie of all-time, in my opinion. It's a high fantasy movie based on books.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>The best sci-fi movie with the best non sci-fi ending.</p>

<h3>Schindler's List</h3>
<p>A historical movie about the World War II.</p>
